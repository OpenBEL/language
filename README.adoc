= BEL Language

The specification(s) for the Biological Expression Language.

http://openbel.github.io/language/[Web view]

== Motivations

* Track changes with source control
* Collaborate on specification through GitHub issues and comments

== Design

Each specification is captured in an individual http://asciidoc.org[asciidoc]-formatted file.

Currently the http://build.openbel.org/browse/BEL-BLS[OpenBEL Build Server] renders the language specifications to HTML. The latest built HTML artifact can be obtained http://build.openbel.org/browse/BEL-BLS/latestSuccessful/artifact/shared/BEL-v1.0-HTML/bel_specification_version_1.0.html[here].

== Work Required


* Port BEL, version 2.0 to asciidoc.
* Collaboration recommendation.

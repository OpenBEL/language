--------

The specification(s) for the Biological Expression Language.

Motivations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Track changes
* Collaboration
* Discuss Issues

Design
~~~~~~

Each specification is captured in an individual http://asciidoc.org[asciidoc]-formatted file that is rendered (manually) to HTML.

The repository has a GitHub website available at http://openbel.github.io/language/[http://openbel.github.io/language/]. Changes need to be pushed to the _gh-pages_ branch in order to change the site.

Work Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Port BEL, version 2.0 to asciidoc.
* Automate rendering of BEL specifications?
* Collaboration recommendation.

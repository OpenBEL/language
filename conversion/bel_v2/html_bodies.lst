<p>The artificial (laboratory) creation of sequence variants is often used to investigate the effects of protein activity or specific post-translational modifications. These include proteins altered to be constitutively active or dominant negative, as well as proteins with specific amino acid residues altered to prevent phosphorylation. While many of these sequence alterations can be precisely represented with BEL, this may not be the best approach to capturing the observations from experiments that use these constructs.</p><h4>Non-phosphorylatable mutant</h4><p>In this example, mutation of FOXO1 serine 256 to alanine is used to block phosphorylation at 256 (S256A), a site phosphorylated by AKT. The S256A mutation was found to impair phosphorylation of threonine 24 and serine 319 by AKT (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11237865">PMID 11237865</a>). <br /> We could represent this observation as follows:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(p.Ser256Ala)) =| p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256))p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(p.Ser256Ala)) =| (p(SFAM:"AKT Family") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 24)))p(HGNC:FOXO1, var(p.Ser256Ala)) =| (p(SFAM:"AKT Family") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 319)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The first statement indicates that phosphorylation at S256 is blocked by mutation of S256 to alanine. The next two statements indicate that the S256A mutation decreases phosphorylation of FOXO1 threonine 24 and serine 319 by AKT.</p><p>However, we are not generally interested in the effects of a lab-created mutant like S256A so much as the role of phosphorylation at serine 256 on phosphorylation of the other two sites. Thus, we recommend the following representation:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256)) =>(p(SFAM:"AKT Family") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 24)))p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 256)) =>(p(SFAM:"AKT Family") => p(HGNC:FOXO1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 319)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Here, the statements indicate that phosphorylation of FOXO1 at S256 increases the phosphorylation of T24 and S319 by the kinase activity of AKT. <br /> While both representations are accurate, the second version is better suited to integrating other information about the role of FOXO1 phosphorylation at S256 into a cohesive, traversable model.</p>
<p>We record the results of experiments like microarrays and RT-PCR, which measure RNA abundances, by representing the object terms as RNA abundances. Only significant effects (e.g., meeting minimum criteria for fold change and statistical significance) should be recorded in BEL Statements.</p><p>In a causal BEL Statement, the subject term generally represents an experimentally manipulated entity while the object term represents a measured entity. Our general practice is to represent the object terms in BEL Statements with the terms most closely related to the experimental measurement.</p><p>This direct representation of the measurement in BEL supports the creation of KAMs to which 'omic data can be mapped directly and analyzed using automated reasoning applications like Whistle. Inference of the potential downstream consequences of RNA expression changes is supported by connection of RNA abundances to the corresponding proteins during knowledge network compilation</p>
<p>Many experimental perturbations involve the overexpression or knockdown of protein abundance. We generally represent this type of experiment using a protein abundance as the subject term instead of an activity (e.g., kinase or phosphatase) of the protein. While many proteins have a known activity, this activity is not always responsible for all downstream effects of overexpression or knockdown; the same effects occur when either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms are expressed.<br /> Below are examples of BEL statements for cases where:</p><ol><li>the effects of increased or decreased protein abundance are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein,</li><li>effects are likely due to an increase or decrease in the activity of the protein, and</li><li>not enough information is available.</li></ol><h4>Effects are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein</h4><p><strong>Example 1</strong>. A mutant telomerase (TERT) protein lacking telomerase activity retains its effects on keratinocyte proliferation (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18208333"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 18208333</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(MGI:Tert) -> bp(GOBP:"cell proliferation")act(p(MGI:Tert), ma(cat)) causesNoChange bp(GOBP:"cell proliferation")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p><strong>Example 2</strong>. The serine-threonine kinase RIPK1 activates NF-kappaB through a mechanism that does not involve the protein's kinase activity (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354226"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 20354226</span></span></a>).</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:RIPK1) -> act(p(GOCC:"NF-kappaB complex"), ma(tscript))act(p(HGNC:RIPK1), ma(kin)) causesNoChange act(p(GOCC:"NF-kappaB complex"), ma(tscript))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h4>Effects are likely due to the activity of the protein</h4><p><strong>Example</strong>.

<p>In some cases an experiment has a complex perturbation, where manipulations of multiple biological entities are required for an effect. Multiple BEL abundance terms can be represented together as the subject of a BEL Statement by using the <code>compositeAbundance()</code> or <code>composite()</code> function.<br /> In this example, TGF-beta cooperates with IL-6 to generate T-helper 17 cells (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17918200"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17918200</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(MGI:Tgfb1), p(MGI:Il6)) -> bp(GOBP:"T-helper 17 cell differentiation")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>If the two manipulated components are known to physically interact (such as a receptor and it's ligand), we recommend inferring their effects rather than using a composite term.<br /> In this example, both Met and Hgf (the Met ligand) are required for increased expression of integrin Itgav RNA (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16710476"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 16710476</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="warning"><ac:rich-text-body><p><strong>Not recommended:</strong></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(MGI:Hgf), p(MGI:Met)) -> r(MGI:Itgav)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="tip"><ac:rich-text-body><p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>kin(p(MGI:Met) ) -> r(MGI:Itgav)p(MGI:Hgf) -> r(MGI:Itgav)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Because Hgf binds to and directly activates Met, the effect of Met and Hgf together on Itgav RNA expression can be inferred to result from Met activity.</p>
<p>For experiments where protein activity is perturbed with a chemical inhibitor, we generally use the chemical as the subject term and not the activity of the target protein. In many cases, the effects of the chemical are not specific to the intended target. This representation approach avoids unintended attribution of off-target effects of a chemical to the target protein.</p><p><br /> For example, treatment of cells with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreases expression of TGFB2 RNA (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20629536"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 20629536</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(SCHEM:"LY 294002") -| r(HGNC:TGFB2)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In a case where more information is available, the protein activity targeted by the inhibitor can be used as the subject term. For example, if the effect of LY 29004 on TGFB2 RNA expression was demonstrated to require the PIK3CA gene, we could represent the subject term as the kinase activity of the PIK3CA protein.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body> act(p(HGNC:PIK3CA), ma(kin)) -> r(HGNC:TGFB2)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro>
<p>For experiments where the perturbation is overexpression of DNA or RNA for the purpose of overexpressing a protein, we generally represent the subject term as a protein abundance.<br /> In this example, SIAH2 and repp86 (TPX2) proteins interact, and overexpression of SIAH2 by transfection increases degradation of TPX2 protein (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17716627"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17716627</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:SIAH2) => deg(p(HGNC:TPX2))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The statement is modeled as direct because the subject and object term proteins interact.<br /> While it would be technically correct to represent overexpressions achieved via DNA transfection as gene abundances and those from mRNA transfections as RNA abundances, this distinction is not useful for applications like Whistle and pathfinding. It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments, if it is not clear that the activity is required or responsible for the effect. <strong><em><span class="confluence-link">&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 0.0px;"><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">When should I use a reaction term?<br /></span></h3><p style="margin-left: 0.0px;"><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Reaction terms allow the representation of a transformation of a list of reactants into a list of products.

<p>A reversible reaction can be represented by modeling the reaction with the products and reactants interchanged.<br /> For example, HSD11B1 acts primarily to convert cortisone to active cortisol, but in some cell types the reverse reaction is favored (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=12530648"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 12530648</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>act(p(HGNC:HSD11B1), ma(cat)) => \ rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:NADPH), a(CHEBI:cortisone)), products(a(CHEBI:"NADP(+)"), a(CHEBI:cortisol)))act(p(HGNC:HSD11B1), ma(cat)) => \ rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:"NADP(+)"), a(CHEBI:cortisol)), products(a(CHEBI:NADPH), a(CHEBI:cortisone)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The top statement represents the forward reaction and the bottom statement represents the reverse reaction.</p>
<p>BEL terms for <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Protein Modifications" /><ac:plain-text-link-body>post-translational modifications of proteins</ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link> specify the type of modification, the modified amino acid, and the position of the modified amino acid. The modified amino acid and position are not required, so protein modifications can be represented with less specific information.</p><h4>Example</h4><h5>Human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at serine 473</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 473))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified serine residue</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph, Ser))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Human AKT1 protein that has been modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified amino acid residue</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(Ph))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p><br /> As a general rule, if specific information is available, it should be used. In some cases, this involves investigation sections of a paper outside of the evidence text or other referenced papers to determine which specific modifications have been measured.<br /> Non-specific protein modification terms have limited value in the context of a knowledge network. For example, phosphorylation at different sites of the same protein can have opposing effects.<br /> For example: &quot;Akt-phosphorylated FOXO interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Skp2 and is targeted for proteasomal degradation&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15917664"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 15917664</span></span></a>)</p><h4>Example</h4><h5>Recommended</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>act(p(SFAM:"AKT Family"), ma(kin)) => (act(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(SFAM:"FOXO Family")))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Not Recommended</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(SFAM:"FOXO Family", pmod(Ph)) => (act(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(SFAM:"FOXO Family")))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first BEL Statement indicates that the kinase activity of AKT increases the degradation of FOXO by SKP2.

<p>Protein families can be used to represent protein abundances in cases where the information presented by the source does not allow identification of the specific protein. For example:</p><h4>Example 1:</h4><p>&quot;Akt physically associates with MDM2 and phosphorylates it at Ser166 and Ser186.&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11715018"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 11715018</span></span></a>)</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>act(p(SFAM:"AKT Family"), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:MDM2, pmod(Ph,Ser,166))act(p(SFAM:"AKT Family"), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:MDM2, pmod(Ph,Ser,186))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Here, Akt may refer to AKT1, AKT2, and/or AKT3.</p><h4>Example 2:</h4><p>&quot;We show that Siah2 is subject to phosphorylation by p38 MAPK ...

Statements can be modeled using the family as well as each individual member.</p>
<p>In many cases a specific protein modification may be dependent on another modification of the same protein. In this case, the first protein modification can be modeled as the upstream cause of the second. In this example, phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at Serine 45 initiates phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at other sites including Threonine 41 by GSK3 (<a href="http://16618120"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 16618120</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 45)) => p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 41))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>We represent this relationship as direct, because the subject and object terms have the same root abundance node.</p><p><br /> Because the kinase mediating the second phosphorylation is known, this relationship can be modeled alternatively as a nested statement:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Ser, 45)) => \	(kin(p(SFAM:"GSK3 Family")) => p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(Ph, Thr, 41)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro>
<p>In many cases two or more distinct modifications are required simultaneously for protein activity, and neither modification alone is sufficient. For example, MAPK3 must be phosphorylated at two sites, Threonine 202 and Tyrosine 204, to be active. Our general practice is to take the simple, most general approach, and model the effect of each site separately:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Thr, 202)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin))p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Tyr, 204)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>A multiply-modified abundance term can be used if it is of high importance to capture the requirement for both modifications:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:MAPK3, pmod(Ph, Thr, 202)), pmod(Ph, Tyr, 204)) => act(p(HGNC:MAPK3), ma(kin))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro>
<p>Removal of a specific protein modification is represented simply as a decrease in the abundance of the modified protein.&nbsp;</p><h3>Deubiquitination</h3><p>In this example, STAMBP deubiquitinates F2RL1 protein (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19684015"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 19684015</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body> act(p(HGNC:STAMBP)) =| p(HGNC:F2RL1, pmod(Ub))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Deubiquitination is represented simply as a decrease in the ubiquitinated form of the protein. Because in this example STAMBP is the deubiquitinating enzyme, we used a <code>directlyDecreases</code> relationship.</p><h3>Dephosphorylation</h3><p>In this example, the phosphatase CDC25C dephosphorylates CDK1 at tyrosine 15 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=1384126"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 1384126</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>act(p(HGNC:CDC25C), ma(phos)) =| p(HGNC:CDK1, pmod(Ph, Tyr, 15))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Similar to deubiquitination, dephosphorylation is represented simply as a decrease in the modified form of the protein.</p>
<p>In many cases, complexes include proteins with post-translational modifications and these modifications influence complex formation. For example, HIF1A that has been hydroxylated on proline residues 402 and 564 interacts with VHL (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17925579"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17925579</span></span></a>).<br /> Our general practice is to represent this type of event as a causal statement in BEL, with the modified protein as the subject term and the complex with no specified modifications as the object term. Because the modified protein is a component of the complex, we use a direct causal relationship:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL))p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 564)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="warning"><ac:rich-text-body><p>While BEL allows representation of complexes with the modified proteins as components, we do not recommend this approach:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402)), p(HGNC:VHL))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The practice of composing a complex using protein abundances without any specified modifications provides a standardized representation for complexes and allows the effects of modifications on complex formation to be captured as causal relationships. The modified forms of HIF1A, <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 402))</code> and <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(Hy, Pro, 564))</code> are considered a subset of the total <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A).</code></p><p>This approach enables representation of the effects of multiple protein modifications on complex formation by using a causal statement for each modification.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>BELv2.0 does not provide a specific representation of unmodified protein abundances.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3>Exception &ndash; modified histones bound to the promoter of a specific gene</h3><p>One exception to our general practice of not specifying protein modifications within complex abundances is the interaction of specific modified histones with the promoter of a specific gene. In this example, cigarette smoke is observed to increase H3K27me3 levels at the DKK1 promoter (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19351856"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 19351856</span></span></a>).</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(SCHEM:"smoke condensate, cigarette (gas phase)") -> \	complex(p(PFH:"Histone H3 Family",pmod(Me3, Lys, 27)), g(HGNC:DKK1))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In this example, the modification of the histone by trimethylation does not affect its binding to the gene DKK1. In addition, cigarette smoke does not increase or decrease the overall abundance of the modified histone, only the abundance of the modified histone at the DKK1 promoter.</p>
<h3>How should I represent gene knock out or RNAi experiments?</h3><p>Our general practice is to represent the subject term for experiments where the perturbation is a gene deletion or RNAi knockdown as the abundance of the corresponding protein.</p><h4>Gene knockouts</h4><p>In this example, mice with a gene deletion of Nfe2l2 express reduced mRNA of the glutathione S transferase Gsta1 compared to wild-type mice (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11991805" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 11991805</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(MGI:Nfe2l2) -> r(MGI:Gsta1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h4>RNA interference</h4><p>In this example, knockdown of PTEN using RNA interference results in increased CDKN1A protein levels (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17300726"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17300726</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:PTEN) -| p(HGNC:CDKN1A)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>We assume that the effects of PTEN RNAi are due to knock down of PTEN protein. Decreased PTEN protein resulting in increased CDKN1A protein is interpreted as PTEN decreases CDKN1A protein. <br /> It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments.

<p>Often, the scientific literature reports a relationship as occurring across several biological contexts.</p><p>Our general practice is to represent each observation with a separate statement. Several annotations can be used to describe the same context, e.g., 'lung' and 'fibroblast', but distinct BEL statements should be used to describe each experimental context that the relationship is observed in.</p><h3>Example</h3><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18650932">PMID 18650932</a> - siRNA knockdown of the atypical PKC-interacting protein Par-4 (PAWR) increases phosphorlyation of AKT at Serine 473 in both human 293 and A549 cells.</p><p>&quot;To test whether this is also true in human cells, we used a Par-4 siRNA to deplete endogenous Par-4 levels in human 293 cells and in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line.

<p>In a causal BEL Statement, the subject term frequently represents an experimentally manipulated entity while the object term represents a measured entity.

<h3>fusion(), fus()</h3><p><strong><code>fusion()</code></strong> or <strong><code>fus()</code></strong> expressions can be used in place of a namespace value within a gene, RNA, or protein abundance function to represent a hybrid gene, or gene product formed from two previously separate genes. <strong><code>fusion()</code></strong> expressions take the general form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>fus(ns5':v5', range5', ns3':v3', range3')</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>where <code>ns5':v5'</code> is a namespace and value for the 5' fusion partner, <code>range5'</code> is the sequence coordinates of the 5' partner, <code>ns3':v3'</code> is a namespace and value for the 3' partner, and <code>range3'</code> is the sequence coordinates for the 3' partner.</p><h4>Example</h4><h5>RNA abundance of fusion with known breakpoints</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>r(fus(HGNC:TMPRSS2, r.1_79, HGNC:ERG, r.312_5034))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The <em>r.</em> designation in the range fields indicates that the numbering uses the RNA sequence as the reference.

<p>Annotations associate context information with BEL Statements, including citation of the source material, evidence text supporting the statement, and the experimental context for the scientific observations represented by the statement. To associate Annotations with statements, Annotations are <code>SET</code> and <code>UNSET</code> within a BEL Document. In the BEL Script syntax, once an Annotation has been <code>SET</code> all following statements inherit the annotation until is explicitly <code>UNSET</code> or a new Annotation of the same type is <code>SET.</code></p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc"><ac:parameter ac:name="maxLevel">3</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro></p><h1>Citation</h1><p>Citations are a special type of annotation that references the knowledge source that reports the observation that the statement is based on. Citations are composed of a document type, a document name, a document reference ID, and an optional publication date, authors list and comment field. For example, the citation for a journal article indexed by PubMed would be encoded as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Citation = {"PubMed", "Genes Cancer. 2010 Jun;1(6):560-567.", "21533016"}</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The document name is a text string containing the reference information, the type is PubMed, and the document reference is the PubMed ID.<br /> The citation for a Reactome pathway would be encoded as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body> SET Citation = {"Online Resource", "p53-Dependent G1 DNA Damage Response", "REACT_1625.1"}</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In this case, the document name is the pathway name, the type is <em>Online Resource</em>, and the reference is the Reactome identifier.</p><h1>SupportingText</h1><p>SupportingText annotations provide the specific text that the statement is derived from. Text should come directly from the abstract or full text of the source referenced by the citation annotation. For example, a supporting text line from the Reactome pathway cited above is:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET SupportingText = "The p53 protein activates the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. p21 inactivates the CyclinE:Cdk2 complexes, and prevent entry of the cell into S phase, leading to G1 arrest."</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h1>Species</h1><p>Species annotations indicate the species context for experimental observation represented by the statement. It is good practice to unambiguously assign species context to BEL Statements, even though many BEL Terms are derived from a species-specific namespace (e.g., HGNC, MGI, RGD). Species annotation uses the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/">NCBI taxonomy ID</a>:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "9606"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Homo sapiens.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "10090"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Mus musculus</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "10116"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Rattus norvegicus.</p><h1>Other Annotation Types</h1><p>Other types of annotations can be added to statements to indicate the context of the experimental observation supported by the statement, including cell line, cell type, and cellular location. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Cell = "Adipocytes, White"SET CellLine = "LoVo"SET Disease = "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"SET Anatomy = "Pulmonary Artery"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>In a BEL Document each Annotation Type that will be used, except for Citation and SupportingText, must be defined in the document header, along with the values allowed for each.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro>
<p>These examples demonstrate the assignment of members to groups.

This relationship is a syntactic convenience that is equivalent to the set of two statements using the <strong><code>hasMember</code></strong> relationship. These statements designate the protein abundances of MAPK8 and MAPK9 as members of the JNK MAPK protein family.

If A or B are <ac:link ac:anchor="act()"><ri:page ri:content-title="Process Functions" /><ac:plain-text-link-body>activities</ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link>, then members of the abundances performing the activities physically interact.</p><h4>Examples</h4><h5>Abundances and activities</h5><p>Inhibition of the Patched 1 receptor signaling activity by Hedgehog is represented as direct, because Hedgehog and Patched 1 physically interact:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(PFH:"Hedgehog Family") =| act(p(HGNC:PTCH1))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Transcription</h5><p>In the case of transcriptional activity, if the protein performing the transcriptional activity interacts with the gene that the RNA is transcribed from, the relationship is considered direct. For example, repression of the transcription of miR-21 by FOXO3 protein transcriptional activity is represented as direct because FOXO3 binds the miR-21 promoter:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>act(p(HGNC:FOXO3),ma(tscript)) =| r(HGNC:MIR21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Target term is BEL statement</h5><p>If B is a BEL Statement, the relationship is considered direct if the subject abundance term for B physically interacts with the abundance term for A. For example, for the BEL Statement:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:CLSPN) => (act(p(HGNC:ATR), ma(kin)) => p(HGNC:CHEK1, pmod(P)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>CLSPN protein is considered to directly activate the phosphorylation of CHEK1 protein by the kinase activity of ATR, because the CLSPN and ATR proteins physically interact.</p><h5>Self-referential relationships</h5><p>Self-referential causal relationships are generally represented as direct. For example, phosphorylation of GSK3B at serine 9 inhibiting the kinase activity of GSK3B can be represented as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:GSK3B, pmod(P, S, 9)) =| act(p(HGNC:GSK3B), ma(kin))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code><br /></code></p>
<p>These relationship types link abundances and biological processes when no causal relationship is known. The order of subject and object terms does not matter in a statement with a correlative relationship, unlike a statement with a causal relationship.</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc" /></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">neg</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>negativeCorrelation, neg</h3><p>For terms A and B, <strong><code>A negativeCorrelation B</code></strong> or <code><strong>A neg B</strong></code> indicates that changes in A and B have been observed to be negatively correlated. The order of the subject and object does not affect the interpretation of the statement, thus <code>B negativeCorrelation A</code> is equivalent to <code>A negativeCorrelation B</code>.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">pos</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>positiveCorrelation, pos</h3><p>For terms A and B, <strong><code>A positiveCorrelation B</code></strong> or <strong><code>A pos B</code></strong> indicates that changes in A and B have been observed to be positively correlated.

The order of the subject and object does not affect the interpretation of the statement, thus <code>B -- A</code> is equivalent to <code>A -- B</code>.</p>

<p>Additional miscellaneous relationship types.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>In most cases, these relationships will be introduced by the BEL Namespace resources, and are not needed for creation of BEL Statements and BEL Documents.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>&nbsp;</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc" /></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">hasMember</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>hasMember</h3><p>For term abundances A and B, <strong><code>A hasMember B</code></strong> designates B as a member class of A. A member class is a distinguished sub-class. A is defined as a group by all of the members assigned to it. The member classes may or may not be overlapping and may or may not entirely cover all instances of A. A term may not appear in both the subject and object of the same hasMember statement</p><h3>hasMembers</h3><p>The<strong><code> hasMembers</code></strong> relationship is a special form which enables the assignment of multiple member classes in a single statement where the object of the statement is a set of abundance terms. A statement using <code>hasMembers</code> is exactly equivalent to multiple <code>hasMember</code> statements. A term may not appear in both the subject and object of the same <code>hasMembers</code> statement. <br /> For the abundance terms A, B, C and D, <code>A hasMembers list(B, C, D)</code> indicates that A is defined by its member abundance classes B, C and D.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">hasComponent</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>hasComponent</h3><p>For complex abundance term A and abundance term B, <strong><code>A hasComponent B</code></strong> designates B as a component of A, that complexes that are instances of A have instances of B as possible components. Note that, the stoichiometry of A is not described, nor is it stated that B is a required component. <br /> The use of<code> hasComponent</code> relationships is complementary to the use of functionally composed complexes and is intended to enable the assignment of components to complexes designated by names in external vocabularies. The assignment of components can potentially enable the reconciliation of equivalent complexes at knowledge assembly time.</p><h3>hasComponents</h3><p>The <strong><code>hasComponents</code></strong> relationship is a special form which enables the assignment of multiple complex components in a single statement where the object of the statement is a set of abundance terms. A statement using <code>hasComponents</code> is exactly equivalent to multiple <code>hasComponent</code> statements. A term may not appear in both the subject and object of the same <code>hasComponents</code> statement. <br /> For the abundance terms A, B, C and D, <code>A hasComponents list(B, C, D)</code> indicates that A has components B, C and D.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">isA</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>isA</h3><p>For terms A and B, <strong><code>A isA B</code></strong> indicates that A is a subset of B.<br /> All terms in BEL 1.0 represent classes, but given that classes implicitly have instances,<code> A isA B</code> is interpreted to mean that any instance of A must also be an instance of B. This relationship can be used to represent GO and MeSH hierarchies:</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code>pathology(MESH:Psoriasis) isA pathology(MESH:&quot;Skin Diseases&quot;)</code></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">subProcessOf</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>subProcessOf</h3><p>For process, activity, or transformation term A and process term P, <strong><code>A subProcessOf P</code></strong> indicates that instances of process P, by default, include one or more instances of A in their composition. For example, the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is a subprocess of cholesterol biosynthesis:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>rxn(reactants(a(CHEBI:"(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA"),a(CHEBI:NADPH), a(CHEBI:hydron)),\ products(a(CHEBI:mevalonate), a(CHEBI:"CoA-SH"), a(CHEBI:"NADP(+)"))) subProcessOf\ bp(GOBP:"cholesterol biosynthetic process")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code><br /></code></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These relationship types link related terms, like orthologous terms from two different species or the <code>geneAbundance()</code> and <code>rnaAbundance()</code> terms for the same namespace value.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>In most cases, these relationships will be introduced by the BEL Namespace resources, and are not needed for creation of BEL Statements and BEL Documents.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>&nbsp;</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc" /></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">orthologous</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>orthologous</h3><p>For terms A and B, <code>A orthologous B</code> indicates that A and B represent entities in different species which are sequence similar and which are therefore presumed to share a common ancestor. For example,</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>g(HGNC:AKT1) orthologous g(MGI:AKT1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>indicates that the mouse and human AKT1 genes are orthologs.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">:&gt;</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>transcribedTo, :&gt;</h3><p>For RNA abundance term R and gene abundance term G, <code>G transcribedTo R</code> or<code> G :&gt; R</code> indicates that members of R are produced by the transcription of members of G. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>g(HGNC:AKT1) :> r(HGNC:AKT1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>indicates that the human AKT1 RNA is transcribed from the human AKT1 gene.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">&gt;&gt;</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>translatedTo, &gt;&gt;</h3><p>For RNA abundance term R and protein abundance term P, <code>R translatedTo P</code> or <code>R &gt;&gt; P</code> indicates that members of P are produced by the translation of members of R. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>r(HGNC:AKT1) >> p(HGNC:AKT1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>indicates that AKT1 protein is produced by translation of AKT1 RNA.</p>

<p>BEL is specifically designed to adopt external vocabularies and ontologies, and represent life-science knowledge in the language and schema of the organization collecting or using the knowledge. Thus, BEL Terms are defined by reference to concepts in external vocabularies, which provide a set of well-known domain values, such as the official human gene symbols provided by HGNC (<a href="http://www.genenames.org/">http://www.genenames.org/</a>) . While we consider it good practice to define biological entities with respect to well-defined domains such as public ontologies, no specific vocabulary is essential to the use of BEL, and users are free to define and reference their own vocabularies as needed.</p><p>BEL uses Namespaces to unambiguously reference concepts. The user associates a Namespace prefix with an external vocabulary and uses the prefix to refer to elements of the vocabulary. For example, if we associate the Namespace prefix HGNC with the vocabulary of symbols managed by the HGNC committee, we can then compose BEL Terms by referencing the HGNC Namespace prefix and any concept from the HGNC namespace together with a relevant BEL Function, e.g., <code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code> or <code>rnaAbundance(HGNC:TNF)</code>.</p><h3>Equivalencing between Namespaces</h3><p>&nbsp;Values from different Namespaces may correspond to the same biological concept. For example, the name AKT1 in the HGNC Namespace refers to the same gene referenced with ID 207 in the EGID (Entrez Gene Identifier) Namespace. The BEL Framework assembles knowledge into a cohesive network, mapping equivalent BEL Terms, e.g., <code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code> and <code>proteinAbundance(EGID:207)</code>, to a single node in the network. This correspondence of Namespace values is handled in the BEL Framework separately from BEL knowledge representation.</p>
<p>Knowledge in BEL is expressed as <ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Statements" /><ac:link-body><strong>BEL Statements</strong></ac:link-body></ac:link>. &nbsp;Generally, BEL Statements have the form of a <em>subject</em> - <em>predicate</em> - <em>object</em> triple, where the subject is a BEL Term, the predicate is one of the BEL relationship types (e.g., <strong><code><em>increases</em></code></strong>), &nbsp;and the object can be either a BEL Term or a BEL Statement. A BEL Statement may also be comprised of a subject term only.</p><p><strong><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Terms" /><ac:plain-text-link-body>BEL Terms</ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></strong> are composed of BEL Functions applied to concepts referenced using <strong><span class="confluence-link"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Namespaces" /><ac:plain-text-link-body>Namespace</ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></span></strong> identifiers. Each BEL Term represents either an abundance of a biological entity, e.g., human AKT1 protein, or a process such as apoptosis.</p><p><strong><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Annotations" /><ac:plain-text-link-body>BEL Annotations</ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link></strong> are applied to BEL Statements to optionally express additional information about the statement itself such as the citation for the publication reporting the observation, or the context in which the observation was made (e.g., species, tissue, cell line).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two general categories of biological entities are represented as BEL Terms: <strong>abundances</strong> and <strong>processes</strong>.</p><h3>Abundances</h3><p>Life science experiments often measure the abundance of a type of thing in a given sample or set of samples. BEL Abundance Terms represent classes of abundance, the abundances of specific types of things. Examples include the <em>protein abundance of TP53</em>, the <em>RNA abundance of CCND1</em>, the <em>abundance of the protein AKT1 phosphorylated at serine 21</em>, or the <em>abundance of the complex of the proteins CCND1 and CDK4</em>.</p><h3>Processes</h3><p>BEL Process Terms represent classes of complex phenomena taking place at the level of the cell or the organism, such as the biological process of <em>cell cycle</em> or a disease process such as <em>Cardiomyopathy</em>. In other cases, BEL Terms may represent classes of specific molecular activities, such as the kinase activity of the AKT1 protein, or a specific chemical reaction like conversion of superoxides to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.</p><p>Measurable biological parameters such as <em>Blood Pressure</em> or&nbsp;<em>Body Temperature</em> are represented as process BEL Terms. These BEL Terms denote biological activities that, when measured, are reduced to an output parameter.</p><h3>BEL Terms as Functional Expressions</h3><p>BEL Terms are denoted by expressions composed of a BEL Function and a list of arguments. BEL v2.0 specifies a set of approximately 20 functions allowed in term expressions.</p><p>The combination of a BEL function and its arguments fully specifies a BEL Term. The BEL Term expression <code>f(a)</code> denotes a BEL Term defined by function <code>f()</code> applied to an argument <code>a</code>. Wherever the same function is applied to the same arguments, the resulting BEL Term references the same biological entity.</p><p>The semantics of a BEL Term are determined by the function used in the term expression. For example, the function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> is defined such that any term expression using <code>proteinAbundance()</code> represents a class of abundance of protein. Many BEL functions take only single values as arguments, providing a structured method of using ontologies and vocabularies in BEL. For example, values in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) vocabulary of official human gene symbols can be used to designate gene, RNA, and protein abundances. The function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> could then be applied to an HGNC gene symbol, <em>AKT1</em> for example, to indicate the class of protein abundances produced by the AKT1 gene, producing the BEL Term <code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code>.</p>
<p>Each BEL Statement can optionally be annotated to express knowledge about the statement itself. Some important uses of annotations are to specify information about the:</p><ul><li>biological system in which the observation represented by the statement was made</li><li>experimental methods used to demonstrate the observation</li><li>knowledge source on which the statement is based, such as the citation and specific text supporting the statement</li></ul><p>Examples of annotations that could be associated with a BEL Statement are the:</p><ul><li>PubMed ID specifying the publication in which the observation was reported,</li><li>Species, tissue, and cellular location in which the observations were made, and</li><li>Dosage, exposure and recovery time associated with the observation.</li></ul>
<p>The Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a language for representing biological observations in a computable form, along with contextual information. BEL is intended as a knowledge capture and interchange medium. BEL is used to qualitatively represent causal and correlative relationships involving biological measurements (e.g., RNA, protein, phosphorylated proteins). Each BEL statement stands alone as an individual observation or fact, and can be integrated with related observations into a cohesive network.</p><p>BEL is a human-readable and -writable language designed to be easy for life scientists to learn and use. &nbsp;BEL is comprised of a relatively small set of function and relationships types that can be used in conjunction with widely used vocabularies like HGNC human gene symbols, Gene Ontology, ChEBI, and MeSH. As a language of discourse for biological findings, BEL is designed to be &quot;white-boardable&quot; as well as written.</p><h3>BEL History</h3><p>BEL was initially designed in 2003 at Selventa (operating as Genstruct&reg;) by Dexter Pratt. BEL was designed with a focus on capturing qualitative causal relationships that could be used for inference.&nbsp; From 2003 to 2010, BEL evolved in response to daily use by scientists representing findings derived from tens of thousands of abstracts and full-text articles.</p><p>In 2011, it was proposed to make BEL an open standard.&nbsp; BEL has been refined, formalized, and extended to meet the needs of a broader community to represent, manage, and share scientific findings in the life sciences. BEL and associated software was released as open-source technology in 2012. OpenBEL became a Linux Foundation Collaborative project in 2013.</p><h3>BEL Version History</h3><ul><li>BEL v1.0 &ndash; initial open source release, 2012</li><li>BEL v2.0 &ndash; major revisions and refinements, 2014</li></ul>
<p>A BEL Statement represents an experimental observation, generally reported in a scientific publication or unpublished experimental data. Generally, BEL Statements express a causal or correlative relationship between two biological entities. Because BEL Terms are functionally composed, a BEL Statement can consist of a single BEL Term; this simple statement indicates that the biological entity represented by the term has been observed.</p><h3>Example BEL Statements</h3><h4>Subject Term Only</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(p(HGNC:CCND1), p(HGNC:CDK4))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><div><p>The abundance of a complex formed from protein abundances designated by <em>CCND1</em> and <em>CDK4</em> in the HGNC namespace.

<p>The following BEL Functions represent classes of abundances of specific types of biological entities like RNAs, proteins, post-translationally modified proteins, and small molecules. Biological experiments frequently involve the manipulation and measurement of entities in samples. These BEL functions specify the type of entity referred to by a namespace value. For example, <code><strong>geneAbundance(HGNC:AKT1</strong>)</code>, <strong><code>rnaAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code></strong>, and <strong><code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code></strong>, represent the abundances of the AKT1 gene, RNA, and protein, respectively.</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc"><ac:parameter ac:name="maxLevel">3</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">a()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>abundance(), a()</h3><p><strong><code>abundance(ns:v)</code></strong> or <code><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);"><strong>a(ns:v)</strong></span></code> denotes the abundance of the entity designated by the value <code><strong>v</strong></code> in the namespace <code><strong>ns</strong></code>. abundance is a general abundance term that can be used for chemicals or other molecules not defined by a more specific abundance function.

This relationship is used when not enough information about the association is available to describe it using more specific relationships, like <code>increases</code> or <code>positiveCorrelation</code>.

<p>Direct relationships include direct causal relationships and non-causal relationships that are considered direct because they are self-referential.</p><h3>Direct causal relationships</h3><p>The direct casual relationships included in BEL V1.0 are <code>directlyIncreases</code> (notational form,<code> =&gt;</code>) and <code>directlyDecreases</code> (notational form, <code>=|</code>). <br /> The direct casual relationships are causal relationships where the mechanism of the causal relationship is based on the physical interaction of entities related to the BEL Statement subject and object terms. <br /> If A or B is an abundance, then members of the abundance are part of the interaction. If A or B are activities, then members of the abundances performing the activities physically interact. For example, inhibition of the Patched 1 receptor signaling activity by Hedgehog is represented as direct, because Hedgehog and Patched 1 physically interact:</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code>p(PFH:&quot;Hedgehog Family&quot;) =| act(p(HGNC:PTCH1))</code></p><p>In the case of transcriptional activity, if the protein performing the transcriptional activity interacts with the gene that the RNA is transcribed from, the relationship is considered direct. For example, repression of the transcription of miR-21 by FOXO3 protein transcriptional activity is represented as direct because FOXO3 binds the miR-21 promoter:</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code>tscript(p(HGNC:FOXO3)) =| r(HGNC:MIR21)</code></p><p>If B is a BEL Statement, the relationship is considered direct if the subject abundance term for B physically interacts with the abundance term for A. For example, for the BEL Statement:</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code>p(HGNC:CLSPN) =&gt; (kin(p(HGNC:ATR)) =&gt; p(HGNC:CHEK1, mod(P)))</code></p><p>CLSPN protein is considered to directly activate the phosphorylation of CHEK1 protein by the kinase activity of ATR, because the CLSPN and ATR proteins physically interact.</p><p>Self-referential causal relationships are generally represented as direct. For example, phosphorylation of GSK3B at serine 9 inhibiting the kinase activity of GSK3B can be represented as:</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><code>p(HGNC:GSK3B, mod(P, S, 9)) =| kin(p(HGNC:GSK3B))</code></p>

<p>Knowledge in BEL is expressed as <strong>BEL Statements</strong>. &nbsp;Generally, BEL Statements have the form of a subject - predicate - object triple, where the subject is a BEL Term, the predicate is one of the BEL relationship types (e.g., <em>increases</em>), &nbsp;and the object can be either a BEL Term or a BEL Statement. A BEL Statement may also be comprised of a subject term only.</p><p><strong>BEL Terms</strong> are composed of BEL Functions applied to concepts referenced using <strong>Namespace</strong> identifiers. Each BEL Term represents either an abundance of a biological entity, e.g., human AKT1 protein, or a process such as apoptosis.</p><p><strong>BEL Annotations</strong> are applied to BEL Statements to optionally express additional information about the statement itself such as the citation for the publication reporting the observation, or the context in which the observation was made (e.g., species, tissue, cell line).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two categories of biological entities are represented as BEL Terms: classes of abundances and classes of processes.</p><h3>Abundances</h3><p>Life science experiments often measure the abundance of a type of thing in a given sample or set of samples.</p><p>BEL Abundance Terms represent classes of abundance, the abundances of specific types of things. Examples include &ldquo;the protein abundance of TP53&rdquo;, &ldquo;the RNA abundance of CCND1&rdquo;, &ldquo;the abundance of the protein AKT1 phosphorylated at serine 21&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the abundance of the complex of the proteins CCND1 and CDK4&rdquo;.</p><h3>Processes</h3><p>BEL Process Terms represent classes of complex phenomena taking place at the level of the cell or the organism, such as the biological process of &quot;cell cycle&quot; or a disease process such as &quot;cardiomyopathy&quot;. In other cases, BEL Terms may represent classes of specific molecular activities, such as the kinase activity of the AKT1 protein, or a specific chemical reaction like conversion of superoxides to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.</p><p>&nbsp;Measurable biological parameters such as &quot;Blood Pressure&quot; or &quot;Body Temperature&quot; are represented as process BEL Terms. These BEL Terms denote biological activities that, when measured, are reduced to an output parameter.</p><h3>BEL Terms as Functional Expressions</h3><p>BEL Terms are denoted by expressions composed of a BEL Function and a list of arguments. BEL v2.0 specifies a set of about 20 <a href="#_msocom_1">[NC1]</a>&nbsp;intrinsic functions allowed in term expressions.</p><p>The combination of a BEL function and its arguments fully specifies a BEL Term. The BEL Term expression f(a) denotes a BEL Term defined by function f() applied to an argument a. Wherever the same function applied to the same arguments is defined, BEL assumes <a href="#_msocom_2">[NC2]</a>&nbsp;these BEL Terms denote the same biological entity.</p><p>The semantics of a BEL Term are determined by the definition of the function used in the term expression. For example, the function proteinAbundance() is defined such that any term expression using proteinAbundance() represents a class of abundance of protein. Many BEL functions take only single values as arguments, providing a structured method of using ontologies and vocabularies in BEL. For example, values in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) vocabulary of official human gene symbols can be used to designate gene, RNA, and protein abundances. The function proteinAbundance() could then be applied to an HGNC gene symbol, AKT1 for example, to indicate the class of protein abundances produced by the AKT1 gene, producing the BEL Term proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1).</p>
<p>Annotations associate context information with BEL Statements, including citation of the source material, evidence text supporting the statement, and the experimental context for the scientific observations represented by the statement. To associate Annotations with statements, Annotations are <code>SET</code> and <code>UNSET</code> within a BEL Document. In the BEL Script syntax, once an Annotation has been <code>SET</code> all following statements inherit the annotation until is explicitly <code>UNSET</code> or a new Annotation of the same type is <code>SET.</code></p><h1>Citation</h1><p>Citations are a special type of annotation that references the knowledge source that reports the observation that the statement is based on. Citations are composed of a document type, a document name, a document reference ID, and an optional publication date, authors list and comment field. For example, the citation for a journal article indexed by PubMed would be encoded as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Citation = {"PubMed", "Genes Cancer. 2010 Jun;1(6):560-567.", "21533016"}</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The document name is a text string containing the reference information, the type is PubMed, and the document reference is the PubMed ID.<br /> The citation for a Reactome pathway would be encoded as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body> SET Citation = {"Online Resource", "p53-Dependent G1 DNA Damage Response", "REACT_1625.1"}</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In this case, the document name is the pathway name, the type is <em>Online Resource</em>, and the reference is the Reactome identifier.</p><h1>SupportingText</h1><p>SupportingText annotations provide the specific text that the statement is derived from. Text should come directly from the abstract or full text of the source referenced by the citation annotation. For example, a supporting text line from the Reactome pathway cited above is:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET SupportingText = "The p53 protein activates the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. p21 inactivates the CyclinE:Cdk2 complexes, and prevent entry of the cell into S phase, leading to G1 arrest."</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h1>Species</h1><p>Species annotations indicate the species context for experimental observation represented by the statement. It is good practice to unambiguously assign species context to BEL Statements, even though many BEL Terms are derived from a species-specific namespace (e.g., HGNC, MGI, RGD). Species annotation uses the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/">NCBI taxonomy ID</a>:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "9606"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Homo sapiens.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "10090"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Mus musculus</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Species = "10116"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Sets the species as Rattus norvegicus.</p><h1>Other Annotation Types</h1><p>Other types of annotations can be added to statements to indicate the context of the experimental observation supported by the statement, including cell line, cell type, and cellular location. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Cell = "Adipocytes, White"SET CellLine = "LoVo"SET Disease = "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"SET Anatomy = "Pulmonary Artery"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>In a BEL Document each Annotation Type that will be used, except for Citation and SupportingText, must be defined in the document header, along with the values allowed for each.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro>

<p>BEL is specifically designed to adopt external vocabularies and ontologies, and represent life-science knowledge in the language and schema of the organization collecting or using the knowledge. Thus, BEL Terms are defined by reference to concepts in external vocabularies, which provide a set of well-known domain values, such as the official human gene symbols provided by HGNC (<a href="http://www.genenames.org/">http://www.genenames.org/</a>) . While we consider it good practice to define biological entities with respect to well-defined domains such as public ontologies, no specific vocabulary is essential to the use of BEL, and users are free to define and reference their own vocabularies as needed.</p><p>BEL uses Namespaces to unambiguously reference concepts. The user associates a Namespace prefix with an external vocabulary and uses the prefix to refer to elements of the vocabulary. For example, if we associate the Namespace prefix HGNC with the vocabulary of symbols managed by the HGNC committee, we can then compose BEL Terms by referencing the HGNC Namespace prefix and any concept from the HGNC namespace together with a relevant BEL Function, e.g., proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1) or rnaAbundance(HGNC:TNF).</p>

These BEL Terms denote biological activities that, when measured, are reduced to an output parameter.</p><h3>BEL Terms as Functional Expressions</h3><p>BEL Terms are denoted by expressions composed of a BEL Function and a list of arguments. BEL v2.0 specifies a set of about 20 functions allowed in term expressions.</p><p>The combination of a BEL function and its arguments fully specifies a BEL Term. The BEL Term expression <code>f(a)</code> denotes a BEL Term defined by function <code>f()</code> applied to an argument <code>a</code>. Wherever the same function is applied to the same arguments, the resulting BEL Term references the same biological entity.</p><p>The semantics of a BEL Term are determined by the function used in the term expression. For example, the function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> is defined such that any term expression using <code>proteinAbundance()</code> represents a class of abundance of protein. Many BEL functions take only single values as arguments, providing a structured method of using ontologies and vocabularies in BEL. For example, values in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) vocabulary of official human gene symbols can be used to designate gene, RNA, and protein abundances. The function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> could then be applied to an HGNC gene symbol, AKT1 for example, to indicate the class of protein abundances produced by the AKT1 gene, producing the BEL Term <code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code>.</p>

For example, <code><strong>geneAbundance(HGNC:AKT1</strong>)</code>, <strong><code>rnaAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code></strong>, and <strong><code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code></strong>, represent the abundances of the AKT1 gene, RNA, and protein, respectively.</p><p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="toc" /></p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">a()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>abundance(), a()</h3><p><strong><code>abundance(ns:v)</code></strong> or <code><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);"><strong>a(ns:v)</strong></span></code> denotes the abundance of the entity designated by the value <code><strong>v</strong></code> in the namespace <code><strong>ns</strong></code>. abundance is a general abundance term that can be used for chemicals or other molecules not defined by a more specific abundance function. Gene, RNA, protein, and microRNA abundances should be represented using the appropriate specific abundance function.</p><h4>Examples - small molecule and chemical</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(CHEBI:"oxygen atom")a(CHEBI:thapsigargin)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">complex()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>complexAbundance(), complex()</h3><p>The <code><strong>complexAbundance()</strong></code> or<code><strong> complex()</strong></code> function can be used with either a namespace value or with a list of abundance terms.</p><p><code><strong>complexAbundance(ns:v)</strong></code> or <code><strong>complex(ns:v)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the molecular complex designated by the value <code><strong>v</strong></code> in the namespace <code><strong>ns</strong></code>. This form is generally used to identify abundances of named complexes.</p><h4>Example - named complex</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(SCOMP:"AP-1 Complex")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p><code><strong>complexAbundance(&lt;abundance term list&gt;)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the molecular complex of members of the abundances denoted by <code><strong>&lt;abundance term list&gt;</strong></code>, a list of abundance terms supplied as arguments. The list is unordered, thus different orderings of the arguments should be interpreted as the same term. Members of a molecular complex retain their individual identities. The <code><strong>complexAbundance()</strong></code> function does not specify the duration or stability of the interaction of the members of the complex.</p><h4>Example - composed complex</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(p(HGNC:FOS), p(HGNC:JUN))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">composite()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>compositeAbundance(), composite()</h3><p>The <code><strong>compositeAbundance(&lt;abundance term list&gt;)</strong></code> function takes a list of abundance terms. <br /> The <code><strong>compositeAbundance()</strong></code> or <code><strong>composite()</strong> </code>function is used to represent cases where multiple abundances synergize to produce an effect. The list is unordered, thus different orderings of the arguments should be interpreted as the same term.<code><strong> </strong></code>This function should not be used if any of the abundances alone are reported to cause the effect. <code><strong>compositeAbundance()</strong> </code>terms should be used only as subjects of statements, not as objects.</p><h4>Example - BEL Statement with compositeAbundance term</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(HGNC:IL6), complex(GOCC:"interleukin-23 complex")) increases bp(GOBP:"T-helper 17 cell differentiation")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In the above example, IL-6 and IL-23 synergistically induce Th17 differentiation.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">g()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>geneAbundance(), g()</h3><p><code><strong>geneAbundance(ns:v)</strong></code> or <code><strong>g(ns:v)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the gene designated by the value v in the namespace ns. <code><strong>geneAbundance()</strong> </code>terms are used to represent the DNA encoding the specified gene. <strong><code>geneAbundance()</code></strong> is considered decreased in the case of a homozygous or heterozygous gene deletion, and increased in the case of a DNA amplification mutation. Events in which a protein binds to the promoter of a gene can be represented using the <code><strong>geneAbundance()</strong></code> function.</p><h4>Example - promoter binding event represented using geneAbundance</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(p(HGNC:TP53), g(HGNC:CDKN1A))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In the above example, the p53 protein binds the CDKN1A gene.</p><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">m()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>microRNAAbundance(), m()</h3><p><code><strong>microRNAAbundance(ns:v)</strong></code> or <code><strong>m(ns:v)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the processed, functional microRNA designated by the value<code> v</code> in the namespace <code>ns</code>.</p><h4>Example - microRNA abundance</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>m(HGNC:MIR21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">p()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>proteinAbundance(), p()</h3><p><code><strong>proteinAbundance(ns:v)</strong></code> or <code><strong>p(ns:v)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the protein designated by the value <code>v</code> in the namespace <code>ns</code>, where <code>v</code> references a gene or a named protein family.</p><h4>Examples - protein abundances</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1) p(SFAM:"AKT Family")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3><ac:structured-macro ac:name="anchor"><ac:parameter ac:name="">r()</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>rnaAbundance(), r()</h3><p><code><strong>rnaAbundance(ns:v)</strong></code> or<code><strong> r(ns:v)</strong></code> denotes the abundance of the RNA designated by the value v in the namespace <code>ns</code>, where <code>v</code> references a gene.

<p>Two categories of biological entities are represented as BEL Terms: <strong>abundances</strong> and <strong>processes</strong>.</p><h3>Abundances</h3><p>Life science experiments often measure the abundance of a type of thing in a given sample or set of samples.</p><p>BEL Abundance Terms represent classes of abundance, the abundances of specific types of things. Examples include the <em>protein abundance of TP53</em>, the <em>RNA abundance of CCND1</em>, the <em>abundance of the protein AKT1 phosphorylated at serine 21</em>, or the <em>abundance of the complex of the proteins CCND1 and CDK4</em>.</p><h3>Processes</h3><p>BEL Process Terms represent classes of complex phenomena taking place at the level of the cell or the organism, such as the biological process of <em>cell cycle</em> or a disease process such as <em>Cardiomyopathy</em>. In other cases, BEL Terms may represent classes of specific molecular activities, such as the kinase activity of the AKT1 protein, or a specific chemical reaction like conversion of superoxides to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.</p><p>&nbsp;Measurable biological parameters such as <em>Blood Pressure</em> or&nbsp;<em>Body Temperature</em> are represented as process BEL Terms. These BEL Terms denote biological activities that, when measured, are reduced to an output parameter.</p><h3>BEL Terms as Functional Expressions</h3><p>BEL Terms are denoted by expressions composed of a BEL Function and a list of arguments. BEL v2.0 specifies a set of about 20 functions allowed in term expressions.</p><p>The combination of a BEL function and its arguments fully specifies a BEL Term. The BEL Term expression <code>f(a)</code> denotes a BEL Term defined by function <code>f()</code> applied to an argument <code>a</code>. Wherever the same function is applied to the same arguments, the resulting BEL Term references the same biological entity.</p><p>The semantics of a BEL Term are determined by the function used in the term expression. For example, the function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> is defined such that any term expression using <code>proteinAbundance()</code> represents a class of abundance of protein. Many BEL functions take only single values as arguments, providing a structured method of using ontologies and vocabularies in BEL. For example, values in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) vocabulary of official human gene symbols can be used to designate gene, RNA, and protein abundances. The function <code>proteinAbundance()</code> could then be applied to an HGNC gene symbol, <em>AKT1</em> for example, to indicate the class of protein abundances produced by the AKT1 gene, producing the BEL Term <code>proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</code>.</p>

For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>SET Cell = "Adipocytes, White"SET CellLine = "LoVo"SET Disease = "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"SET CardiovascularSystem = "Pulmonary Artery"</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>In a BEL Document each Annotation Type that will be used, except for Citation and Evidence, must be defined in the document header, along with the values allowed for each.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro>

<div class="expand-content"><p>Correlative relationships are more appropriate than causal relationships to represent observations that do not clearly result from an experimental perturbation.

<p>Removal of a specific protein modification is represented simply as a decrease in the abundance of the modified protein.&nbsp;</p><h3>Deubiquitination</h3><p>In this example, STAMBP deubiquitinates F2RL1 protein (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19684015"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 19684015</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body> cat(p(HGNC:STAMBP)) =| p(HGNC:F2RL1, pmod(U))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Deubiquitination is represented simply as a decrease in the ubiquitinated form of the protein.

<p>In many cases a specific protein modification may be dependent on another modification of the same protein. In this case, the first protein modification can be modeled as the upstream cause of the second. In this example, phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at Serine 45 initiates phosphorylation of CTNNB1 at other sites including Threonine 41 by GSK3 (<a href="http://16618120"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 16618120</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(P, S, 45)) => p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(P, T, 41))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>We represent this relationship as direct, because the subject and object terms have the same root abundance node.</p><p><br /> Because the kinase mediating the second phosphorylation is known, this relationship can be modeled alternatively as a nested statement:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(P, S, 45)) => \	(kin(p(PFH:"GSK3 Family")) => (HGNC:CTNNB1, pmod(P, T, 41)))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro>
<p>In many cases, complexes include proteins with post-translational modifications and these modifications influence complex formation. For example, HIF1A that has been hydroxylated on proline residues 402 and 564 interacts with VHL (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17925579"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17925579</span></span></a>).<br /> Our general practice is to represent this type of event as a causal statement in BEL, with the modified protein as the subject term and the complex with no specified modifications as the object term. Because the modified protein is a component of the complex, we use a direct causal relationship:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(H, P, 402)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL))p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(H, P, 564)) => complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A), p(HGNC:VHL))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="warning"><ac:rich-text-body><p>While BEL allows representation of complexes with the modified proteins as components, we do not recommend this approach:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex(p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(H, P, 402)), p(HGNC:VHL))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The practice of composing a complex using protein abundances without any specified modifications provides a standardized representation for complexes and allows the effects of modifications on complex formation to be captured as causal relationships. The modified forms of HIF1A, <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(H, P, 402))</code> and <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A, pmod(H, P, 564))</code> are considered a subset of the total <code>p(HGNC:HIF1A).</code></p><p>This approach enables representation of the effects of multiple protein modifications on complex formation by using a causal statement for each modification.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="note"><ac:rich-text-body><p>BEL does not provide a specific representation of unmodified protein abundances.</p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h3>Exception &ndash; modified histones bound to the promoter of a specific gene</h3><p>One exception to our general practice of not specifying protein modifications within complex abundances is the interaction of specific modified histones with the promoter of a specific gene. In this example, cigarette smoke is observed to increase H3K27me3 levels at the DKK1 promoter (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19351856"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 19351856</span></span></a>).</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(SCHEM:"smoke condensate, cigarette (gas phase)") -> \	complex(p(PFH:"Histone H3 Family",pmod(M, K, 27)), g(HGNC:DKK1))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In this example, the modification of the histone by methylation does not affect its binding to the gene DKK1. In addition, cigarette smoke does not increase or decrease the overall abundance of the modified histone, only the abundance of the modified histone at the DKK1 promoter.</p>
<p>BEL terms for post-translational modifications of proteins specify the type of modification, the modified amino acid, and the position of the modified amino acid. The modified amino acid and position are not required, so protein modifications can be represented with less specific information. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(P, S, 473))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at serine 473.</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(P, S))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents human AKT1 protein modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified serine residue</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:AKT1, pmod(P))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents human AKT1 protein that has been modified by phosphorylation at an unspecified amino acid residue.</p><p><br /> As a general rule, if specific information is available, it should be used. In some cases, this involves investigation sections of a paper outside of the evidence text or other referenced papers to determine which specific modifications have been measured.<br /> Non-specific protein modification terms have limited value in the context of a Knowledge Assembly Model (KAM). For example, phosphorylation at different sites of the same protein can have opposing effects.<br /> For example: &quot;Akt-phosphorylated FOXO interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Skp2 and is targeted for proteasomal degradation&quot; (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15917664"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 15917664</span></span></a>)<br /><em>Recommended:</em></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>kin(p(PFH:"AKT Family")) => \	(cat(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(PFH:"FOXO Family Hs")))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="warning"><ac:rich-text-body><p><em>Not recommended:</em></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(PFH:"FOXO Family", pmod(P)) => (cat(p(HGNC:SKP2)) => deg(p(PFH:"FOXO Family Hs")))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The first BEL Statement indicates that the kinase activity of AKT increases the degradation of FOXO by SKP2. The second statement indicates that phosphorylation of FOXO increases the degradation of FOXO by SKP2. In this case, more information is captured by using the phosphorylating kinase AKT as the subject term instead of the non-specified phosphorylation of FOXO.</p>
<p>For experiments where the perturbation is overexpression of DNA or RNA for the purpose of overexpressing a protein, we generally represent the subject term as a protein abundance.<br /> In this example, SIAH2 and repp86 (TPX2) proteins interact, and overexpression of SIAH2 by transfection increases degradation of TPX2 protein (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17716627"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17716627</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:SIAH2) => deg(p(HGNC:TPX2))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The statement is modeled as direct because the subject and object term proteins interact.<br /> While it would be technically correct to represent overexpressions achieved via DNA transfection as gene abundances and those from mRNA transfections as RNA abundances, this distinction is not useful for applications like Whistle and pathfinding. It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments, if it is not clear that the activity is required or responsible for the effect.

<h3>How should I represent gene knock out or RNAi experiments?</h3><p>Our general practice is to represent the subject term for experiments where the perturbation is a gene deletion or RNAi knockdown as the abundance of the corresponding protein.</p><h4>Gene knockouts</h4><p>In this example, mice with a gene deletion of Nfe2l2 express reduced mRNA of the glutathione S transferase Gsta1 compared to wild-type mice (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11991805" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 11991805</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(MGI:Nfe2l2) -> r(MGI:Gsta1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h4>RNA interference</h4><p>In this example, knockdown of PTEN using RNA interference results in increased CDKN1A protein levels (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17300726"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17300726</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(HGNC:PTEN) -| p(HGNC:CDKN1A)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>We assume that the effects of PTEN RNAi are due to knock down of PTEN protein. Decreased PTEN protein resulting in increased CDKN1A protein is interpreted as PTEN decreases CDKN1A protein. <br /> It is generally preferable to represent the subject term as the protein abundance and not an activity of the protein, particularly for 'omic experiments.

<p>For experiments where protein activity is perturbed with a chemical inhibitor, we generally use the chemical as the subject term and not the activity of the target protein. In many cases, the effects of the chemical are not specific to the intended target. This representation approach avoids unintended attribution of off-target effects of a chemical to the target protein.</p><p><br /> For example, treatment of cells with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreases expression of TGFB2 RNA (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20629536"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 20629536</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(SCHEM:"LY 294002") -| r(HGNC:TGFB2)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>In a case where more information is available, the protein activity targeted by the inhibitor can be used as the subject term.

<p>We record the results of experiments like microarrays and RT-PCR, which measure RNA abundances, by representing the object terms as RNA abundances.

<p>The artificial (laboratory) creation of sequence variants is often used to investigate the effects of protein activity or specific post-translational modifications. These include proteins altered to be constitutively active or dominant negative, as well as proteins with specific amino acid residues altered to prevent phosphorylation. While many of these sequence alterations can be precisely represented with BEL, this may not be the best approach to capturing the observations from experiments that use these constructs.</p><h4>Non-phosphorylatable mutant</h4><p>In this example, mutation of FOXO1 serine 256 to alanine is used to block phosphorylation at 256 (S256A), a site phosphorylated by AKT.

<p>In some cases an experiment has a complex perturbation, where manipulations of multiple biological entities are required for an effect. Multiple BEL abundance terms can be represented together as the subject of a BEL Statement by using the <code>compositeAbundance()</code> or <code>composite()</code> function.<br /> In this example, TGF-beta cooperates with IL-6 to generate T-helper 17 cells (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17918200"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 17918200</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(MGI:Tgfb1), p(MGI:Il6)) -> bp(GO:"T-helper 17 cell differentiation")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>If the two manipulated components are known to physically interact (such as a receptor and it's ligand), we recommend inferring their effects rather than using a composite term.<br /> In this example, both Met and Hgf (the Met ligand) are required for increased expression of integrin Itgav RNA (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16710476"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 16710476</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="warning"><ac:rich-text-body><p><strong>Not recommended:</strong></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(MGI:Hgf), p(MGI:Met)) -> r(MGI:Itgav)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><ac:structured-macro ac:name="tip"><ac:rich-text-body><p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>kin(p(MGI:Met) ) -> r(MGI:Itgav)p(MGI:Hgf) -> r(MGI:Itgav)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Because Hgf binds to and directly activates Met, the effect of Met and Hgf together on Itgav RNA expression can be inferred to result from Met activity.</p>
<p>Many experimental perturbations involve the overexpression or knockdown of protein abundance. We generally represent this type of experiment using a protein abundance as the subject term instead of an activity (e.g., kinase or phosphatase) of the protein. While many proteins have a known activity, this activity is not always responsible for all downstream effects of overexpression or knockdown; the same effects occur when either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms are expressed.<br /> Below are examples of BEL statements for cases where:</p><ol><li>the effects of increased or decreased protein abundance are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein,</li><li>effects are likely due to an increase or decrease in the activity of the protein, and</li><li>not enough information is available.</li></ol><h4>Effects are not due to the catalytic activity of the protein</h4><p><strong>Example 1</strong>. A mutant telomerase (TERT) protein lacking telomerase activity retains its effects on keratinocyte proliferation (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18208333"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMID 18208333</span></span></a>):</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(MGI:Tert) -> bp(GO:"cell proliferation")cat(p(MGI:Tert)) causesNoChange bp(GO:"cell proliferation")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p><strong>Example 2</strong>.

<p>Term activity functions are applied to protein, complex, and RNA abundances to specify the frequency of events resulting from the molecular activity of the abundance. This distinction is particularly useful for proteins whose activities are regulated by post-translational modification. BEL V1.0 supports 10 distinct activity functions that can be applied to abundances of proteins, complexes, or RNAs.</p><h2>Catalytic activities</h2><p>The <code>catalyticActivity()</code> or <code>cat()</code> function is used to represent the frequency of events in which the molecular activity of proteins, complexes, or ribozymes act as an enzymatic catalyst of biochemical reactions. Kinase, phosphatase, peptidase, and ADP-ribosylase activities are represented by the more specific catalytic activity functions, <code>kinaseActivity()</code>,<code> phosphataseActivity()</code>, <code>ribosylaseActivity()</code>, and <code>peptidaseActivity()</code>, respectively. <br /> For example, an activity like super oxide dismutase can be represented using the general <code>catalyticActivity()</code> function:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>catalyticActivity(proteinAbundance(RGD:Sod1))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>cat(p(RGD:Sod1))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the frequency of events in which the protein abundance of rat Sod1 acts as a catalyst. <br /> The activity of proteases to hydrolyze peptide bonds can be represented using the more specific <code>peptidaseActivity()</code> or <code>pep()</code> function:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>peptidaseActivity(proteinAbundance(MGI:Casp3))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>pep(p(MGI:Casp3))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the frequency of events in which the protein abundance of mouse Casp3 acts as a peptidase.</p><h2>G-proteins in the active (GTP-bound) state</h2><p>The activity of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) like RAS in the active, GTP-bound state can be represented using the <code>gtpBoundActivity()</code> or <code>gtp()</code> function.

For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>chaperoneActivity(proteinAbundance(HGNC:CANX))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>chap(p(HGNC:CANX))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the events in which the human Calnexin protein functions as a chaperone to aid the folding of other proteins.</p><h2>Transcription activity</h2><p>Events in which a protein or molecular complex acts to directly control transcription are represented using the<code> transcriptionalActivity()</code> or <code>tscript()</code> function. This includes proteins acting directly as transcription factors, as well as transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>transcriptionalActivity(proteinAbundance(MGI:Trp53))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>tscript(p(MGI:Trp53))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the frequency of events in which the mouse p53 protein controls RNA expression.</p><h2>Other activities</h2><p>Activities that are not represented by one of the specific activity functions can be represented using the <code>molecularActivity()</code> or <code>act()</code> function.

For example, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 together form the AKT family. Like other proteins, abundances of protein families are represented using the <code>proteinAbundance(ns:v)</code> or <code>p(ns:v)</code> function, where <code>ns</code> is a namespace of protein families like the Selventa named protein families namespace.</p><h4>Example</h4><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(SFAM:"AKT Family")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the protein abundance of the AKT protein family.</p><h2>microRNAs</h2><p>The abundance function <code>microRNAAbudance(ns:v)</code> or <code>m(ns:v)</code> is used to represent the fully processed, active form of a microRNA. The specific abundance functions allow distinct representations of the gene, RNA, and microRNA abundances for a given namespace value.</p><h4>Example</h4><h5>Long Form</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>geneAbundance(MGI:Mir21) rnaAbundance(MGI:Mir21) microRNAAbundance(MGI:Mir21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><h5>Short Form</h5><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>g(MGI:Mir21) r(MGI:Mir21) m(MGI:Mir21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>These BEL Terms represent the abundances of the gene, RNA, and processed microRNA, respectively, for the entity specified by <em>Mir21</em> in the MGI mouse gene symbol namespace.</p><h2>Complexes</h2><p>The abundances of molecular complexes are represented using the complexAbundance() or complex() function. This function can take either a list of abundance terms or a value from a namespace of molecular complexes as its argument.

The first by referencing a named protein complex within the Selventa named protein complexes namespace, and the second by enumerating the individual protein abundances that compose the IkappaB kinase complex, CHUK, IKBKB, and IKBKG.</p><h2>Composite abundances</h2><p>Multiple abundance terms can be represented together as the subject of a BEL Statement by using the compositeAbundance() or composite() function. This function takes a list of abundances as its argument and is used when the individual abundances do not act alone, but rather synergize to produce an effect. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>compositeAbundance(proteinAbundance(HGNC:TGFB1), proteinAbundance(HGNC:IL6))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(HGNC:TGFB1), p(HGNC:IL6))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the combined abundances of TGFB1 and IL6 proteins.</p>
<p>Measurable entities like genes, RNAs, proteins, and small molecules are represented as abundances in BEL. BEL Terms for abundances have the general form <code>a(ns:v)</code>, where a is an abundance function, <code>ns</code> is a namespace reference and <code>v</code> is a value from the namespace vocabulary. BEL V1.0 has seven abundance functions to designate different types of abundances.</p><h2>Chemicals and Small Molecules</h2><p>The general abundance function <code>abundance(ns:v)</code>, or <code>a(ns:v)</code>, is used to represent abundances of chemicals, small molecules, and any other entities that cannot be represented by a more specific abundance function. Examples are:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>abundance(CHEBI:"nitrogen atom")abundance(CHEBI:"prostaglandin J2")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>The same abundance terms can be expressed equivalently using the short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>a(CHEBI:"nitrogen atom")a(CHEBI:"prostaglandin J2")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>These BEL Terms represent the abundance of the entities specified by &quot;nitrogen atom&quot; and by &quot;prostaglandin J2&quot; in the CHEBI namespace.</p><h2>Genes, RNAs, and proteins</h2><p>The abundance functions <code>geneAbundance(ns:v)</code>,<code> rnaAbundance(ns:v)</code>, and <code>proteinAbundance(ns:v)</code> are used with namespace values like HGNC human gene symbols, EntrezGene IDs, SwissProt accession numbers to designate the type of molecule represented. For example, abundances of the gene, RNA, and protein encoded by the human AKT1 gene are represented as:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>geneAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)rnaAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)proteinAbundance(HGNC:AKT1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>g(HGNC:AKT1)r(HGNC:AKT1)p(HGNC:AKT1)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>These BEL Terms represent the gene, RNA, and protein abundances of the entity specified by &quot;AKT1&quot; in the HGNC namespace. Equivalent terms can be constructed using a corresponding value from a different namespace. For example, the abundance of the human AKT1 RNA can also be represented by referencing the EntrezGene ID or SwissProt accession namespaces:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>r(EG:207)r(SPA:P31749)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Corresponding terms created using different namespaces are identified and merged into a single term through namespace equivalencing in the BEL Framework.</p><h2>Protein families</h2><p>Protein families are used to represent a group of functionally similar proteins. For example, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 together form the AKT family. Like other proteins, abundances of protein families are represented using the <code>proteinAbundance(ns:v)</code> or <code>p(ns:v)</code> function, where <code>ns</code> is a namespace of protein families like the Selventa named protein families namespace. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>p(PFH:"AKT Family")</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the protein abundance of the AKT protein family.</p><h2>microRNAs</h2><p>The abundance function <code>microRNAAbudance(ns:v)</code> or <code>m(ns:v)</code> is used to represent the fully processed, active form of a microRNA. The specific abundance functions allow distinct representations of the gene, RNA, and microRNA abundances for a given namespace value. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>geneAbundance(MGI:Mir21) rnaAbundance(MGI:Mir21) microRNAAbundance(MGI:Mir21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>g(MGI:Mir21) r(MGI:Mir21) m(MGI:Mir21)</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>These BEL Terms represent the abundances of the gene, RNA, and processed microRNA, respectively, for the entity specified by &quot;Mir21&quot; in the MGI mouse gene symbol namespace.</p><h2>Complexes</h2><p>The abundances of molecular complexes are represented using the complexAbundance() or complex() function. This function can take either a list of abundance terms or a value from a namespace of molecular complexes as its argument. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complexAbundance(NCH:IkappaB Kinase Complex) complexAbundance(proteinAbundance(HGNC:CHUK), proteinAbundance(HGNC:IKBKB), proteinAbundance(HGNC:IKBKG))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>complex (NCH:"IkappaB Kinase Complex") complex(p(HGNC:CHUK), p(HGNC:IKBKB), p(HGNC:IKBKG))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Both BEL Terms represent the human IkappaB kinase complex. The first by referencing a named protein complex within the Selventa named protein complexes namespace, and the second by enumerating the individual protein abundances that compose the IkappaB kinase complex, CHUK, IKBKB, and IKBKG.</p><h2>Composite abundances</h2><p>Multiple abundance terms can be represented together as the subject of a BEL Statement by using the compositeAbundance() or composite() function. This function takes a list of abundances as its argument and is used when the individual abundances do not act alone, but rather synergize to produce an effect. For example:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>compositeAbundance(proteinAbundance(HGNC:TGFB1), proteinAbundance(HGNC:IL6))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>short form:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code"><ac:plain-text-body>composite(p(HGNC:TGFB1), p(HGNC:IL6))</ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>This term represents the combined abundances of TGFB1 and IL6 proteins.</p>
